# SEIR-Interactive
An interactive visualization of the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model using Matplotlib. The simulation allows real-time parameter adjustments via sliders and text boxes, making it easy to explore epidemic dynamics. The model is implemented with the explicit Euler method for numerical integration.
